# Arcade-Pang-Game
A recreation of the classical arcade game: Pang

In this build I have used the MVC Architecture along with Dependency Injection (Vcontainer)
I normally choose Zenject but people recommended Vcontainer as a more upto date tool,
I thought it would be nice to try it out as I know Zenject pretty well and it's not too different.

This project contains three consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty in the form of Zones/Areas and zone stages.
Only by fully clearing a zone can you proceed to the next zone/Area

The project was completed alongside full-time job, resulting in a tight timeline that focused primarily on game mechanics rather than visibility.
Due to these time constraints, I made the decision not to include any form of scoring or leaderboard.
Additionally, testing the local network would require additional devices, which I currently don't have access to.
